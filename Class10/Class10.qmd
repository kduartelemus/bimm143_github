## The PDB Database

The main repository of biomolecular structure data is called the PDB https://www.rcsb.org

Let's see what this database contains. I went to PDB > Analyze > PDB Statistics > By Exp method and molecular type.a

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
pdbstats
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
```

The comma in these numbers is causing them to be read as characters rather than numeric.

I can fix this by replacing "," for nothing "" with the `sub()` function
```{r}
x <- pdbstats$X.ray
sum(as.numeric( sub(",", "", x) ))
```

Or, I can use the **readr** package and the `read_csv()` function.
```{r}
library(readr)
pdbstats <- read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```

I want to clean up the column names so that they are all lower case and don't have spaces in them
```{r}
library(janitor)
pdbstats <- clean_names(pdbstats)
pdbstats
```

Total number of X-ray structures
```{r}
xraysum <- sum(pdbstats$x_ray)
```

Total number of EM structures
```{r}
emsum <- sum(pdbstats$em)
```

Total number of structures
```{r}
totalstruc <- sum(pdbstats$total)
```

Percentage of X-ray structures
```{r}
xraysum/totalstruc *100
```

Percentage of EM structures
```{r}
emsum/totalstruc *100
```


> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

Total number of protein structures
```{r}
pdbstats[1,]$total / sum(pdbstats$total) *100
```

## 2. Using Mol*

The main Mol* homepage at: https://molstar.org/viewer/
We can input our own PDB files or just give it a PDB accession code (4 letter PDB code)

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

There are 231,029 HIV-1 protease structures currently in PDB

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

This is a simplified view.

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

HOH 308

> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

## 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R

We can use the **bio3d** package for structural bioinformatics to read PDB data into R
```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

```{r}
length(pdbseq(pdb))
```

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

MK1

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2 chains, A and B

Looking at the `pdb` object in more detail
```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Let's try a new function not yet in the bio3d package. It requires the **r3dmol** and **shiny** package that we need to install with `install.packages("r3dmol")` and `install.packages("shiny")`

```{r}
source("https://tinyurl.com/viewpdb")
#view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor = "peachpuff")
```

## 4. Predicting functional dynamics

We can use the `nma()` function in bio3d to predict the large-scale functional motions of biomolecules.

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write out a trajectory of the predicted molecular motion:
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
